# Horiseon

## Description

This website is a landing page for the company Horiseon. This project was focused on adding accessibilty and increasing SEO (Search Engine Optimization), while adding more concise html and css. The company Horiseon helps other companies with marketing and SEO. To visit the landing page, follow this link: mheyn95.github.io/Horiseon. 

I helped Horiseon by improving the html code by using semantics, adding a title, and adding "alt" text for pictures. I also condensed the css code by combining style rules for similar blocks of code.
